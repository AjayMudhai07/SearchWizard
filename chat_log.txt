Message 2: Message(role='assistant', content='Thought: To find the most booked hotel, I should calculate the total rooms booked for each hotel. Since we have the `hotel_bookings` table containing the ids of the booked rooms, I should join it with the `hotel_room_types` table to get the corresponding hotel id for each booking. I will then group the result by `hotel_id` and count the rows for each hotel. The hotel with the highest count is the most booked hotel. I\'ll write a SQL query and use the `query_database` function to execute it. \n\nAction: {\n  "function": "functions.query_database",\n  "parameters": {\n    "query": "\n    SELECT h.hotel_id, h.hotel_name, COUNT(*) AS total_bookings\n    FROM hotel_bookings hb\n    INNER JOIN hotel_room_types hrt ON hb.room_type_id = hrt.room_type_id\n    INNER JOIN hotels h ON hrt.hotel_id = h.hotel_id\n    GROUP BY h.hotel_id, h.hotel_name\n    ORDER BY total_bookings DESC \n    LIMIT 1\n    "\n  }\n}', name=None, function_call={'name': 'query_database', 'arguments': '{\n"query": "SELECT h.hotel_id, h.hotel_name, COUNT(*) AS total_bookings FROM hotel_bookings hb INNER JOIN hotel_room_types hrt ON hb.room_type_id = hrt.room_type_id INNER JOIN hotels h ON hrt.hotel_id = h.hotel_id GROUP BY h.hotel_id, h.hotel_name ORDER BY total_bookings DESC LIMIT 1"\n}'})
